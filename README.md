# Traking_and_Calculating_Knee_angle_Using_a_Video
This Python script uses MediaPipe Pose and OpenCV to perform real-time joint angle tracking from a video file (Snatch1.mp4). It detects human pose landmarks, extracts the coordinates of the right hip, knee, and ankle, and calculates the knee joint angle using vector mathematics. The script displays the live video with pose connections and the current angle overlayed, while simultaneously recording the angle over time. After processing, it plots a time-vs-angle graph using Matplotlib, enabling performance analysis for exercises, sports techniques, or motion studies.
